# War thunder payload calculator

Current goals:
- User will be able to filter by plane first, and then by that plane's bombs if they want to
- User will be able to select the number of bases they want to destroy
- If the amount of bombs needed cannot be carried by that place a message will be displayed warning that the plane is incapable of destroying that amount of bases
- Selector with image of the planes (maybe)
